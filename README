The svn master repository is located here:

  http://svn.concord.org/svn/ccsailportal/trunk

The public git repository is located here:

  git://github.com/stepheneb/ccsailportal.git

When commits are made to the master svn repository they are
are automatically pulled to a private git clone of the subversion 
repository and from there pushed to the public git repository.

Currently there are two branches of development:

* trunk
* itemservice

The git branch named 'master' is tracking the svn branch 
named 'trunk'.

A Trac instance has been setup to provide both visualization
of and rss feeds of changesets here: 

  http://trac.cosmos.concord.org/ccsailportal

In addition the service hosting the git repository has
commit visualization also:
